- Keep dependencies up to date

### For Users
- Always use the latest stable version
- Keep your system and dependencies updated
- Use strong authentication methods
- Monitor for security advisories

## Security Tools Used

- **CodeQL**: Static analysis security testing
- **Trivy**: Container vulnerability scanning
- **GitLeaks**: Secret detection
- **Cargo Audit**: Rust dependency vulnerability checking
- **npm audit**: Node.js dependency vulnerability checking

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response** (0-24 hours)
   - Assess the severity and scope
   - Implement immediate containment measures
   - Notify affected users if necessary

2. **Investigation** (24-72 hours)
   - Conduct thorough investigation
   - Identify root cause
   - Develop remediation plan

3. **Resolution** (3-7 days)
   - Implement fixes
   - Deploy security updates
   - Verify resolution effectiveness

4. **Post-Incident** (7-14 days)
